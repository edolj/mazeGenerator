# mazeGenerator

I wrote a code to generate random maze in C programming language using the Depth-first search algorithm. It was all made possible with abstract data type called stack. Input of the program wants height and width of maze, output is generated maze (2d array). In my case the path always starts with position (1,1) in maze. Stack stores the values x and y which tells you position of current cell.
